  description: |
    urlquote is not intended to be a replacement for urllib. urllib is part of the Python standard
    library and should be your go-to choice to quote and unquote URLs. However, should quoting or
    unquoting of URLs be known to be a performance bottleneck and you are fine with the encodings
    provided, then by all means have fun using this library.
